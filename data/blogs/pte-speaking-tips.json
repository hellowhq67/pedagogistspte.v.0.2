  "content": "<h2>1. Maintain Oral Fluency</h2><p>Fluency is key in PTE. Do not hesitate or self-correct. Keep speaking at a steady matching your natural pace.</p><h2>2. Focus on Pronunciation</h2><p>Speak clearly and enunciate your words. You don't need a native accent, but you must be understood by the computer.</p><h2>3. Describe Image Structure</h2><p>Use a template for Describe Image. Identify the title, axes, and key trends. Conclude with a prediction or summary.</p><h2>4. Retell Lecture Note-taking</h2><p>Write down keywords, not sentences. Use arrows to connect ideas and reconstruct the lecture flow.</p><h2>5. Microphone Position</h2><p>Place the microphone parallel to your nose, about 2-3 fingers away. Avoid breathing directly into it to prevent popping sounds.</p><h2>6. Don't Stop Speaking</h2><p>If you make a mistake, keep going. Stopping or correcting yourself will hurt your fluency score more than the mistake itself.</p><h2>7. Use Intonation</h2><p>Vary your pitch to sound natural. Monotone speech can be interpreted as robotic and lower your score.</p><h2>8. Practice Read Aloud</h2><p>Read with purpose. Stress important words and pause effectively at punctuation marks.</p><h2>9. Answer Short Question</h2><p>Keep your answers brief. Usually, one or two words are enough. Don't overcomplicate it.</p><h2>10. Stay Calm</h2><p>Anxiety affects breathing and speech rate. Take a deep breath before each task and focus on the screen.</p>"
