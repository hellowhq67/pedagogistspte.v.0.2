      audioText: `Biodiversity conservation is facing unprecedented challenges in the 21st century. Scientists estimate that species are going extinct at a rate 100 to 1000 times faster than the natural background rate. Habitat destruction, climate change, pollution, and invasive species are the primary drivers of this crisis. Protected areas cover about 15% of Earth's land surface, but many experts argue this is insufficient.

Conservation efforts are evolving to address these challenges. Traditional approaches focused on protecting individual species, but modern conservation increasingly emphasizes ecosystem-based management. Corridor projects that connect isolated habitats allow species to migrate and maintain genetic diversity. Community-based conservation programs recognize that local people must be partners in protection efforts, not obstacles to them.

The economic value of biodiversity is becoming better understood. Ecosystem services such as pollination, water purification, and carbon sequestration provide trillions of dollars in benefits annually. As these values are incorporated into economic decision-making, there is hope that conservation can become not just an ethical imperative but an economic necessity.`
